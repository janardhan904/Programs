Prime number is a number that is greater than 1 and divided by 1 or itself only. 
In other words, prime numbers can't be divided by other numbers than itself or 1. 
For example 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17.... are the prime numbers

Some interesting fact about Prime numbers:
->Two is the only even Prime number.
->Every prime number can represented in form of 6n+1 or 6n-1 except 2 and 3, where n is natural number.
->Two and Three are only two consecutive natural numbers which are prime too.
->Goldbach Conjecture: Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.
->GCD of all other natural numbers with a prime is always one


public static void main(String[] args) {
			
			int num=50;
			int count=0;
			for(int i=2;i<=num;i++){
			count=0;
			for(int j=2;j<=i/2;j++){
			if(i%j==0){
			count++;
			break;
			}
			}
			if(count==0){
			System.out.println(i);
			}
		}
